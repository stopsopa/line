```
or


angle and distance

    cls: '_line', 
    id : false,
    css: {  
        // you can change styles of div in js here through $(..).css()
        // but be careful that you can override here property used
        // to calculations ('width') 
        // which is defined right below        
        height: '0',
        zIndex: '999',
        zoom: 1
    },
